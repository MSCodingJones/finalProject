                <h2>HOW ELLAHONEY BEGAN</h2>

                <h3> Shaquella Jones founded EllaHoney when her four year old twins asked for a ballerina birthday party. Convinced she could create tutus better than the ones she saw in stores, Shaquella made two of cutest ballerina tutus for her nieces. 
                    The EllaHoney is named after Shaquella's grandmother Ella, an exceptional semastress in her own right, and the woman that taught her how to sew a-line tulle skirts, Honey.  Honey was the grandmother of Shaquella's friend but she quickly became family.
